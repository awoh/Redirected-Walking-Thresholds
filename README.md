# Redirected-Walking-Thresholds
Code for a virtual reality experiment designed to measure the imperceptibility of redirected walking gains

This is part of a research study that measured RDW rotation thresholds considering different conditions including FOV, disrtactor presence, gender, and simulator sickness.
This work is a collaboration between Niall Williams and Dr. Tabitha Peck.
The paper summarizing our results has been accepted for publication to the IEEE VR journal. It is currently under revision.
